# Description

When on [ultraboost category](https://www.adidas.fi/ultraboost), 26 colors are shown as shown in [category screenshot](ultraboost_category_Screenshot 2020-10-25 113412.png).
However, when going to the [item page](https://www.adidas.fi/ultraboost-20-shoes/FV8319.html), 25 colors are shown. It seems as if there's some kind of mismatch between data source systems, as it seems to happen in other items with "26 colors" in main category, but not with other items with less colors (19 or 3).
